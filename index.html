            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a statistician in the Medical Affairs group at <a href="https://www.astellas.com/en/">Astellas Pharma</a>. In addition, I am currently working on my PhD in the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/research/statistics-probability/">Statistics and Probability</a> group at the University of York. My PhD research is looking at applying wavelet methods to problems in medical statistics. Previously, I was a senior statistical analyst at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis department. I have several years of experience of clinical trial analysis and health technology assessment procedures. I started at OPEN Health after graduating with an MMath in Mathematics from the University of York. I also have an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications from the University of Sheffield.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        My primary area of interest is applied/computational statistics, particularly with applications to medicine and sport. 

        <ul>
            <li>Analysis of Clincal Trials</li>
            <li>Evidence Synthesis Methods and Application</li>
            <li>Computational Statistics</li>
            <li>Comparative Effectiveness Methods</li>
        </ul>

        In terms of medicine, I am primarily interested in the following indications:

        <ul>
            <li>Oncology</li>
            <li>Neurology and Psychiatry</li>
