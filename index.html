            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a statistician at Astellas Pharma, working on oncology trials. Previously, I was a senior statistical analyst at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis department. I started at OPEN Health straight after graduating with an MMath in Mathematics from the University of York. I have recently completed an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications at the University of Sheffield. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am primarily interested in the design and analysis of clinical trials. I am also interested in indirect treatment comparisons using survival outcomes, and the application of survival anlaysis to health economic modelling. I have research experience in several areas of oncology- in particular, chronic lymphocytic leukeamia, and pancreatic cancer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of my work, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating. I also enjoy hiking and reading.

        <p>
            My MMath thesis concerned the re-setting of score targets in limited overs cricket. You can read it <a href="PDFs/mmath.pdf">here</a>. My MSc thesis was a network meta-analysis in pancreatic cancer, and can be found <a href="PDFs/main.pdf">here</a>.
