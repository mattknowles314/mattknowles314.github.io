        <p>
            I am a Statistician at Open Health, working in Modelling and Meta-Analysis. I am fascinated by many areas of applied maths, and have found my way into applying maths to the healthcare 
            industry. I'm really excited to be entering this industry in the coming months, and can't wait to get stuck into the interesting problems ahead of me.
        </p>

        <P>
            Looking to the future, I would like to persue a PhD in Bioinformatics within the next 4-5 years, but for now, I need a bit of a break from education.

        </P>

        <p>
            Outside of academia, I am a keen sportsman, competing in cricket and field hockey, as well as training long-distance running year round.
            I am a fan of Birmingham City FC, and Worcestershire County Cricket Club.
