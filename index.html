            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a statistician at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis centre of excellence. I started work straight after graduating with an MMath in 
            Mathematics from the University of York. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications at the University of Sheffield. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am primarily interested in the design and analysis of clinical trials. In particular, I am interested in indirect treatment comparisons using survival outcomes, and the application of survival anlaysis to health economic modelling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of academia, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating.
