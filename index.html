        <p>
            In my day job, I am a statististican at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis centre of excellence. I started work straight after graduating with an MMath in 
            Mathematics from the University of York. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications at the University of Sheffield. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academia, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating. My sporting focus has switched
            back to long distance running now, which is something I started at university, but was a support act to my cricket, but has now become my other main focus outside of work.

        Running is a big part of my life, and is my main focus outside of work. My main distance is the marathon. At the minute, my PBs are nothing to write home about, but I'm looking forward to watching them come down.
        I represent Worcester Athletics Club primarily and the University of Sheffield - you can check out my results on <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=1165059">Power of 10</a>.
