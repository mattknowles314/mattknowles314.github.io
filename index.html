            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a senior statistical analyst at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis department. I started work straight after graduating with an MMath in 
            Mathematics from the University of York. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications at the University of Sheffield.

        <p>
            I am primarily interested in the design and analysis of clinical trials. In particular, I am interested in indirect treatment comparisons using survival outcomes, and the application of survival anlaysis to health economic modelling. I have research experience in several areas of oncology- in particular, chronic lymphocytic leukeamia, and pancreatic cancer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of my work, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating.

            My MMath thesis concerned the resetting of score targets in limited overs cricket. You can read it <a href="PDFs/mmath.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. My MSc thesis was a network meta analysis in pancreatic cancer. This will be made available after I recieve a grade.
