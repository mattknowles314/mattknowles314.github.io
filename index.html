            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a statistician at Astellas Pharma, working on oncology trials. Previously, I was a senior statistical analyst at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis department. I started at OPEN Health straight after graduating with an MMath in Mathematics from the University of York. I also have an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications from the University of Sheffield.

            My area of interest in Statistics, particularly applied/computational statistics. I am primarily interested in the design and analysis of clinical trials in oncology. I am also interested in evidence synthesis methods such as network meta-analysis. My primary theraputic area of interest is pancreatic cancer. In September 2025, I will be running the Langdale Marathon for Pancreatic Cancer UK. You can support the cause <a href="www.justgiving.com/fundraising/mattklangdale2025">here</a>.

        <p>
            My MMath thesis concerned the re-setting of score targets in limited overs cricket. You can read it <a href="PDFs/mmath.pdf">here</a>. My MSc thesis was a network meta-analysis in pancreatic cancer, and can be found <a href="PDFs/main.pdf">here</a>.
