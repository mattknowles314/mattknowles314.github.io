        <p>
            In my day job, I am a statististican at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis centre of excellence. I started work straight after graduating with an MMath in 
            Mathematics from the University of York. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics 
        </p>

        <P>
            Looking to the future, I would like to pursue a PhD in the next couple of years. I don't know what area I would like to study, as I have a lot of interests. I am a big fan of 
            applied mathematics/statistics, but I also really enjoy computer science topics such as alogirthm and complexity theory. A topic at the intersection of these would be ideal.

        </P>

        <p>
            Outside of academia, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating. My sporting focus has switched
            back to long distance running now. I have represented the University of Sheffield in Cross Country, and am targeting the Manchester Marathon in April 2023.
