        <p>
            In my day job, I am a statististican at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis centre of excellence. I started work straight after graduating with an MMath in 
            Mathematics from the University of York. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications at the University of Sheffield. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My main interests are Survival Analysis, Computational Statistics, and Mathematical Finance. Most of my work is in R, but I am also familiar with C/C++ and Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of academia, I am a keen sportsman, I represented the University of York Men's Cricket Club for 3 years, earning Full Colours upon graduating. I still play cricket in the Surrey County League.

            These are the (public) packages I'm involved with the maintaining of. I help maintain several internal R packages at work. I primarily work on the Survival Analysis-focused package.
