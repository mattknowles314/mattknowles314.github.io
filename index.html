            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a statistician at Astellas Pharma. Previously, I was a senior statistical analyst at OPEN Health, working in the Modelling & Meta-Analysis department. I started at OPEN Health straight after graduating with an MMath in Mathematics from the University of York. I also have an MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications from the University of Sheffield. I am currently working part-time on my PhD whilst working at Astellas.
